<h3 class="section">6.3 Cryptographic Functions</h3>

<p class="noindent">Some functions operating on S-expressions support `flags' to influence
the operation.  These flags have to be listed in a sub-S-expression
named `flags'.  Flag names are case-sensitive.  The following flags
are known:

     <dl>
<dt><code>comp</code><dt><code>nocomp</code><dd><a name="index-comp-97"></a><a name="index-nocomp-98"></a>If supported by the algorithm and curve the <code>comp</code> flag requests
that points are returned in compact (compressed) representation.  The
<code>nocomp</code> flag requests that points are returned with full
coordinates.  The default depends on the the algorithm and curve. 
The compact representation requires a small overhead before a point
can be used but halves the size of a to be conveyed public key.

     <br><dt><code>pkcs1</code><dd><a name="index-PKCS1-99"></a>Use PKCS#1 block type 2 padding for encryption, block type 1 padding
for signing.

     <br><dt><code>oaep</code><dd><a name="index-OAEP-100"></a>Use RSA-OAEP padding for encryption.

     <br><dt><code>pss</code><dd><a name="index-PSS-101"></a>Use RSA-PSS padding for signing.

     <br><dt><code>eddsa</code><dd><a name="index-EdDSA-102"></a>Use the EdDSA scheme signing instead of the default ECDSA algorithm. 
Note that the EdDSA uses a special form of the public key.

     <br><dt><code>rfc6979</code><dd><a name="index-RFC6979-103"></a>For DSA and ECDSA use a deterministic scheme for the k parameter.

     <br><dt><code>no-blinding</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dblinding-104"></a>Do not use a technique called `blinding', which is used by default in
order to prevent leaking of secret information.  Blinding is only
implemented by RSA, but it might be implemented by other algorithms in
the future as well, when necessary.

     <br><dt><code>param</code><dd><a name="index-param-105"></a>For ECC key generation also return the domain parameters.  For ECC
signing and verification override default parameters by provided
domain parameters of the public or private key.

     <br><dt><code>transient-key</code><dd><a name="index-transient_002dkey-106"></a>This flag is only meaningful for RSA, DSA, and ECC key generation.  If
given the key is created using a faster and a somewhat less secure
random number generator.  This flag may be used for keys which are
only used for a short time or per-message and do not require full
cryptographic strength.

     <br><dt><code>use-x931</code><dd><a name="index-X9_002e31-107"></a>Force the use of the ANSI X9.31 key generation algorithm instead of
the default algorithm. This flag is only meaningful for RSA key
generation and usually not required.  Note that this algorithm is
implicitly used if either <code>derive-parms</code> is given or Libgcrypt is
in FIPS mode.

     <br><dt><code>use-fips186</code><dd><a name="index-FIPS-186-108"></a>Force the use of the FIPS 186 key generation algorithm instead of the
default algorithm.  This flag is only meaningful for DSA and usually
not required.  Note that this algorithm is implicitly used if either
<code>derive-parms</code> is given or Libgcrypt is in FIPS mode.  As of now
FIPS 186-2 is implemented; after the approval of FIPS 186-3 the code
will be changed to implement 186-3.

     <br><dt><code>use-fips186-2</code><dd><a name="index-FIPS-186_002d2-109"></a>Force the use of the FIPS 186-2 key generation algorithm instead of
the default algorithm.  This algorithm is slightly different from
FIPS 186-3 and allows only 1024 bit keys.  This flag is only meaningful
for DSA and only required for FIPS testing backward compatibility.

<p class="noindent">Now that we know the key basics, we can carry on and explain how to
encrypt and decrypt data.  In almost all cases the data is a random
session key which is in turn used for the actual encryption of the real
data.  There are 2 functions to do this:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: gcry_error_t <b>gcry_pk_encrypt</b> (<var>gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;*r_ciph,<!-- /@w --> gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;data,<!-- /@w --> gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;pkey<!-- /@w --></var>)<var><a name="index-gcry_005fpk_005fencrypt-110"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>Obviously a public key must be provided for encryption.  It is
expected as an appropriate S-expression (see above) in <var>pkey</var>. 
The data to be encrypted can either be in the simple old format, which
is a very simple S-expression consisting only of one MPI, or it may be
a more complex S-expression which also allows to specify flags for
operation, like e.g. padding rules.

     <p class="noindent">If you don't want to let Libgcrypt handle the padding, you must pass an
appropriate MPI using this expression for <var>data</var>:

     <pre class="example">          (data
            (flags raw)
            (value <var>mpi</var>))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This has the same semantics as the old style MPI only way.  <var>MPI</var>
is the actual data, already padded appropriate for your protocol. 
Most RSA based systems however use PKCS#1 padding and so you can use
this S-expression for <var>data</var>:

     <pre class="example">          (data
            (flags pkcs1)
            (value <var>block</var>))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Here, the "flags" list has the "pkcs1" flag which let the function know
that it should provide PKCS#1 block type 2 padding.  The actual data to
be encrypted is passed as a string of octets in <var>block</var>.  The
function checks that this data actually can be used with the given key,
does the padding and encrypts it.

        <p>If the function could successfully perform the encryption, the return
value will be 0 and a new S-expression with the encrypted result is
allocated and assigned to the variable at the address of <var>r_ciph</var>. 
The caller is responsible to release this value using
<code>gcry_sexp_release</code>.  In case of an error, an error code is
returned and <var>r_ciph</var> will be set to <code>NULL</code>.

     <p class="noindent">The returned S-expression has this format when used with RSA:

     <pre class="example">          (enc-val
            (rsa
              (a <var>a-mpi</var>)))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Where <var>a-mpi</var> is an MPI with the result of the RSA operation.  When
using the Elgamal algorithm, the return value will have this format:

     <pre class="example">          (enc-val
            (elg
              (a <var>a-mpi</var>)
              (b <var>b-mpi</var>)))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Where <var>a-mpi</var> and <var>b-mpi</var> are MPIs with the result of the
Elgamal encryption operation. 
</p></blockquote></div>
   <!-- end gcry_pk_encrypt -->

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: gcry_error_t <b>gcry_pk_decrypt</b> (<var>gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;*r_plain,<!-- /@w --> gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;data,<!-- /@w --> gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;skey<!-- /@w --></var>)<var><a name="index-gcry_005fpk_005fdecrypt-111"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>Obviously a private key must be provided for decryption.  It is expected
as an appropriate S-expression (see above) in <var>skey</var>.  The data to
be decrypted must match the format of the result as returned by
<code>gcry_pk_encrypt</code>, but should be enlarged with a <code>flags</code>
element:

     <pre class="example">          (enc-val
            (flags)
            (elg
              (a <var>a-mpi</var>)
              (b <var>b-mpi</var>)))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This function does not remove padding from the data by default.  To
let Libgcrypt remove padding, give a hint in `flags' telling which
padding method was used when encrypting:

     <pre class="example">          (flags <var>padding-method</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Currently <var>padding-method</var> is either <code>pkcs1</code> for PKCS#1 block
type 2 padding, or <code>oaep</code> for RSA-OAEP padding.

     <p class="noindent">The function returns 0 on success or an error code.  The variable at the
address of <var>r_plain</var> will be set to NULL on error or receive the
decrypted value on success.  The format of <var>r_plain</var> is a
simple S-expression part (i.e. not a valid one) with just one MPI if
there was no <code>flags</code> element in <var>data</var>; if at least an empty
<code>flags</code> is passed in <var>data</var>, the format is:

     <pre class="example">          (value <var>plaintext</var>)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
   <!-- end gcry_pk_decrypt -->

   <p>Another operation commonly performed using public key cryptography is
signing data.  In some sense this is even more important than
encryption because digital signatures are an important instrument for
key management.  Libgcrypt supports digital signatures using
2 functions, similar to the encryption functions:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: gcry_error_t <b>gcry_pk_sign</b> (<var>gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;*r_sig,<!-- /@w --> gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;data,<!-- /@w --> gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;skey<!-- /@w --></var>)<var><a name="index-gcry_005fpk_005fsign-112"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>This function creates a digital signature for <var>data</var> using the
private key <var>skey</var> and place it into the variable at the address of
<var>r_sig</var>.  <var>data</var> may either be the simple old style S-expression
with just one MPI or a modern and more versatile S-expression which
allows to let Libgcrypt handle padding:

     <pre class="example">           (data
            (flags pkcs1)
            (hash <var>hash-algo</var> <var>block</var>))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This example requests to sign the data in <var>block</var> after applying
PKCS#1 block type 1 style padding.  <var>hash-algo</var> is a string with the
hash algorithm to be encoded into the signature, this may be any hash
algorithm name as supported by Libgcrypt.  Most likely, this will be
"sha256" or "sha1".  It is obvious that the length of <var>block</var> must
match the size of that message digests; the function checks that this
and other constraints are valid.

     <p class="noindent">If PKCS#1 padding is not required (because the caller does already
provide a padded value), either the old format or better the following
format should be used:

     <pre class="example">          (data
            (flags raw)
            (value <var>mpi</var>))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Here, the data to be signed is directly given as an <var>MPI</var>.

     <p class="noindent">For DSA the input data is expected in this format:

     <pre class="example">          (data
            (flags raw)
            (value <var>mpi</var>))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Here, the data to be signed is directly given as an <var>MPI</var>.  It is
expect that this MPI is the the hash value.  For the standard DSA
using a MPI is not a problem in regard to leading zeroes because the
hash value is directly used as an MPI.  For better standard
conformance it would be better to explicit use a memory string (like
with pkcs1) but that is currently not supported.  However, for
deterministic DSA as specified in RFC6979 this can't be used.  Instead
the following input is expected.

     <pre class="example">          (data
            (flags rfc6979)
            (hash <var>hash-algo</var> <var>block</var>))
</pre>
        <p>Note that the provided hash-algo is used for the internal HMAC; it
should match the hash-algo used to create <var>block</var>.

     <p class="noindent">The signature is returned as a newly allocated S-expression in
<var>r_sig</var> using this format for RSA:

     <pre class="example">          (sig-val
            (rsa
              (s <var>s-mpi</var>)))
</pre>
        <p>Where <var>s-mpi</var> is the result of the RSA sign operation.  For DSA the
S-expression returned is:

     <pre class="example">          (sig-val
            (dsa
              (r <var>r-mpi</var>)
              (s <var>s-mpi</var>)))
</pre>
        <p>Where <var>r-mpi</var> and <var>s-mpi</var> are the result of the DSA sign
operation.

        <p>For Elgamal signing (which is slow, yields large numbers and probably
is not as secure as the other algorithms), the same format is used
with "elg" replacing "dsa"; for ECDSA signing, the same format is used
with "ecdsa" replacing "dsa".

        <p>For the EdDSA algorithm (cf. Ed25515) the required input parameters are:

     <pre class="example">          (data
            (flags eddsa)
            (hash-algo sha512)
            (value <var>message</var>))
</pre>
        <p>Note that the <var>message</var> may be of any length; hashing is part of
the algorithm.  Using a large data block for <var>message</var> is not
suggested; in that case the used protocol should better require that a
hash of the message is used as input to the EdDSA algorithm.

        </blockquote></div>
   <!-- end gcry_pk_sign -->

<p class="noindent">The operation most commonly used is definitely the verification of a
signature.  Libgcrypt provides this function:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: gcry_error_t <b>gcry_pk_verify</b> (<var>gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;sig<!-- /@w -->, gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;data<!-- /@w -->, gcry_sexp_t&nbsp;pkey<!-- /@w --></var>)<var><a name="index-gcry_005fpk_005fverify-113"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>This is used to check whether the signature <var>sig</var> matches the
<var>data</var>.  The public key <var>pkey</var> must be provided to perform this
verification.  This function is similar in its parameters to
<code>gcry_pk_sign</code> with the exceptions that the public key is used
instead of the private key and that no signature is created but a
signature, in a format as created by <code>gcry_pk_sign</code>, is passed to
the function in <var>sig</var>.

     <p class="noindent">The result is 0 for success (i.e. the data matches the signature), or an
error code where the most relevant code is <code>GCRY_ERR_BAD_SIGNATURE</code>
to indicate that the signature does not match the provided data.

        </blockquote></div>
