<h2 class="appendix">Annexe B Description of the FIPS Mode</h2>

<p>This appendix gives detailed information pertaining to the FIPS mode. 
In particular, the changes to the standard mode and the finite state
machine are described.  The self-tests required in this mode are
described in the appendix on self-tests.

<h3 class="section">B.1 Restrictions in FIPS Mode</h3>

<p class="noindent">If Libgcrypt is used in FIPS mode these restrictions are effective:

     <ul>
<li>The cryptographic algorithms are restricted to this list:

          <dl>
<dt>GCRY_CIPHER_3DES<dd>3 key EDE Triple-DES symmetric encryption. 
<br><dt>GCRY_CIPHER_AES128<dd>AES 128 bit symmetric encryption. 
<br><dt>GCRY_CIPHER_AES192<dd>AES 192 bit symmetric encryption. 
<br><dt>GCRY_CIPHER_AES256<dd>AES 256 bit symmetric encryption. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA1<dd>SHA-1 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA224<dd>SHA-224 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA256<dd>SHA-256 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA384<dd>SHA-384 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA512<dd>SHA-512 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA1,GCRY_MD_FLAG_HMAC<dd>HMAC using a SHA-1 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA224,GCRY_MD_FLAG_HMAC<dd>HMAC using a SHA-224 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA256,GCRY_MD_FLAG_HMAC<dd>HMAC using a SHA-256 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA384,GCRY_MD_FLAG_HMAC<dd>HMAC using a SHA-384 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_MD_SHA512,GCRY_MD_FLAG_HMAC<dd>HMAC using a SHA-512 message digest. 
<br><dt>GCRY_PK_RSA<dd>RSA encryption and signing. 
<br><dt>GCRY_PK_DSA<dd>DSA signing. 
</dl>

     <p>Note that the CRC algorithms are not considered cryptographic algorithms
and thus are in addition available.

     <li>RSA key generation refuses to create a key with a keysize of
less than 1024 bits.

     <li>DSA key generation refuses to create a key with a keysize other
than 1024 bits.

     <li>The <code>transient-key</code> flag for RSA and DSA key generation is ignored.

     <li>Support for the VIA Padlock engine is disabled.

     <li>FIPS mode may only be used on systems with a /dev/random device. 
Switching into FIPS mode on other systems will fail at runtime.

     <li>Saving and loading a random seed file is ignored.

     <li>An X9.31 style random number generator is used in place of the
large-pool-CSPRNG generator.

     <li>The command <code>GCRYCTL_ENABLE_QUICK_RANDOM</code> is ignored.

     <li>Message digest debugging is disabled.

     <li>All debug output related to cryptographic data is suppressed.

     <li>On-the-fly self-tests are not performed, instead self-tests are run
before entering operational state.

     <li>The function <code>gcry_set_allocation_handler</code> may not be used.  If
it is used Libgcrypt disables FIPS mode unless Enforced FIPS mode is
enabled, in which case Libgcrypt will enter the error state.

     <li>The digest algorithm MD5 may not be used.  If it is used Libgcrypt
disables FIPS mode unless Enforced FIPS mode is enabled, in which case
Libgcrypt will enter the error state.

     <li>In Enforced FIPS mode the command <code>GCRYCTL_DISABLE_SECMEM</code> is
ignored.  In standard FIPS mode it disables FIPS mode.

     <li>A handler set by <code>gcry_set_outofcore_handler</code> is ignored. 
<li>A handler set by <code>gcry_set_fatalerror_handler</code> is ignored.

   </ul>

   <p>Note that when we speak about disabling FIPS mode, it merely means
that the function <code>gcry_fips_mode_active</code> returns false; it does
not mean that any non FIPS algorithms are allowed.

<h3 class="section">B.2 FIPS Finite State Machine</h3>

<p>The FIPS mode of libgcrypt implements a finite state machine (FSM) using
8 states (see <a href="tbl_003afips_002dstates.html#tbl_003afips_002dstates">tbl:fips-states</a>) and checks at runtime that only valid
transitions (see <a href="tbl_003afips_002dstate_002dtransitions.html#tbl_003afips_002dstate_002dtransitions">tbl:fips-state-transitions</a>) may happen.

   <p><strong class="float-caption">Figure B.1: FIPS mode state diagram</strong></p></div>

   <div class="float">
<a name="tbl_003afips_002dstates"></a>
States used by the FIPS FSM:
     <dl>
<dt>Power-Off<dd>Libgcrypt is not runtime linked to another application.  This usually
means that the library is not loaded into main memory.  This state is
documentation only.

     <br><dt>Power-On<dd>Libgcrypt is loaded into memory and API calls may be made.  Compiler
introduced constructor functions may be run.  Note that Libgcrypt does
not implement any arbitrary constructor functions to be called by the
operating system

     <br><dt>Init<dd>The Libgcrypt initialization functions are performed and the library has
not yet run any self-test.

     <br><dt>Self-Test<dd>Libgcrypt is performing self-tests.

     <br><dt>Operational<dd>Libgcrypt is in the operational state and all interfaces may be used.

     <br><dt>Error<dd>Libgrypt is in the error state.  When calling any FIPS relevant
interfaces they either return an error (<code>GPG_ERR_NOT_OPERATIONAL</code>)
or put Libgcrypt into the Fatal-Error state and won't return.

     <br><dt>Fatal-Error<dd>Libgcrypt is in a non-recoverable error state and
will automatically transit into the  Shutdown state.

     <br><dt>Shutdown<dd>Libgcrypt is about to be terminated and removed from the memory. The
application may at this point still running cleanup handlers.

   </dl>
   <p><strong class="float-caption">Table B.1: FIPS mode states</strong></p></div>

   <div class="float">
<a name="tbl_003afips_002dstate_002dtransitions"></a>
The valid state transitions (see <a href="fig_003afips_002dfsm.html#fig_003afips_002dfsm">Figure B.1</a>) are:
     <dl>
<dt><code>1</code><dd>Power-Off to Power-On is implicitly done by the OS loading Libgcrypt as
a shared library and having it linked to an application.

     <br><dt><code>2</code><dd>Power-On to Init is triggered by the application calling the
Libgcrypt initialization function <code>gcry_check_version</code>.

     <br><dt><code>3</code><dd>Init to Self-Test is either triggered by a dedicated API call or implicit
by invoking a libgrypt service controlled by the FSM.

     <br><dt><code>4</code><dd>Self-Test to Operational is triggered after all self-tests passed
successfully.

     <br><dt><code>5</code><dd>Operational to Shutdown is an artificial state without any direct action
in Libgcrypt.  When reaching the Shutdown state the library is
deinitialized and can't return to any other state again.

     <br><dt><code>6</code><dd>Shutdown to Power-off is the process of removing Libgcrypt from the
computer's memory.  For obvious reasons the Power-Off state can't be
represented within Libgcrypt and thus this transition is for
documentation only.

     <br><dt><code>7</code><dd>Operational to Error is triggered if Libgcrypt detected an application
error which can't be returned to the caller but still allows Libgcrypt
to properly run.  In the Error state all FIPS relevant interfaces return
an error code.

     <br><dt><code>8</code><dd>Error to Shutdown is similar to the Operational to Shutdown transition
(5).

     <br><dt><code>9</code><dd>Error to Fatal-Error is triggered if Libgrypt detects an fatal error
while already being in Error state.

     <br><dt><code>10</code><dd>Fatal-Error to Shutdown is automatically entered by Libgcrypt
after having reported the error.

     <br><dt><code>11</code><dd>Power-On to Shutdown is an artificial state to document that Libgcrypt
has not ye been initialized but the process is about to terminate.

     <br><dt><code>12</code><dd>Power-On to Fatal-Error will be triggered if certain Libgcrypt functions
are used without having reached the Init state.

     <br><dt><code>13</code><dd>Self-Test to Fatal-Error is triggered by severe errors in Libgcrypt while
running self-tests.

     <br><dt><code>14</code><dd>Self-Test to Error is triggered by a failed self-test.

     <br><dt><code>15</code><dd>Operational to Fatal-Error is triggered if Libcrypt encountered a
non-recoverable error.

     <br><dt><code>16</code><dd>Operational to Self-Test is triggered if the application requested to run
the self-tests again.

     <br><dt><code>17</code><dd>Error to Self-Test is triggered if the application has requested to run
self-tests to get to get back into operational state after an error.

     <br><dt><code>18</code><dd>Init to Error is triggered by errors in the initialization code.

     <br><dt><code>19</code><dd>Init to Fatal-Error is triggered by non-recoverable errors in the
initialization code.

     <br><dt><code>20</code><dd>Error to Error is triggered by errors while already in the Error
state.

<!-- ******************************************** -->
<h3 class="section">B.3 FIPS Miscellaneous Information</h3>

<p>Libgcrypt does not do any key management on itself; the application
needs to care about it.  Keys which are passed to Libgcrypt should be
allocated in secure memory as available with the functions
<code>gcry_malloc_secure</code> and <code>gcry_calloc_secure</code>.  By calling
<code>gcry_free</code> on this memory, the memory and thus the keys are
overwritten with zero bytes before releasing the memory.

   <p>For use with the random number generator, Libgcrypt generates 3
internal keys which are stored in the encryption contexts used by the
RNG.  These keys are stored in secure memory for the lifetime of the
process.  Application are required to use <code>GCRYCTL_TERM_SECMEM</code>
before process termination.  This will zero out the entire secure
memory and thus also the encryption contexts with these keys.
