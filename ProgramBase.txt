First understand that we have 3 stages of work .. 

First stage : MasterServer

  Masterserver are a network of 2 or more servers used to register and track games server. 
  
  They have a separate channel of communication, hold a database for themself, gameservers and players.
  
  The communication port used for master to master will be 6060 (arbitrary choose as a free of use channel port)
  
  Online configuration can be hold by a Light http server include in the code at port 8010 (arbitrary)
  
  All comunications between masters and servers , masters and clients, servers and clients will be encrypted using
  the libgcrypt library
  
  In the database, we have 3 tables. 
  
    First table : master_data
          <1> Number     integer
          <2> Name       char
          <3> IP         char
          <4> NetName    char
          <5> last_seen  date
          <6> config     (to be defined)
          
    Second table : server_data
