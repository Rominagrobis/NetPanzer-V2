This is a masterserv, a server that is able to manage a list of currently
running gameservers. It's not very polished yet, but the code should be robust
and stable. You should adapt the serverconfig and neighbor (other masterservers
in the network) to your need and then simply start the server.

Informations about the protocol can be found in the docs directory.
The exampleclient directory contains an example client, more advanced usage
(like keeping a local list of masterserver in sync) can be found in the
netpanzer project.
