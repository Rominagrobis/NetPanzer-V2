<h3 class="section">2.4 Initializing the library</h3>

<p>Before the library can be used, it must initialize itself.  This is
achieved by invoking the function <code>gcry_check_version</code> described
below.

   <p>Also, it is often desirable to check that the version of
Libgcrypt used is indeed one which fits all requirements. 
Even with binary compatibility, new features may have been introduced,
but due to problem with the dynamic linker an old version may actually
be used.  So you may want to check that the version is okay right
after program startup.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: const char * <b>gcry_check_version</b> (<var>const char *req_version</var>)<var><a name="index-gcry_005fcheck_005fversion-2"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>The function <code>gcry_check_version</code> initializes some subsystems used
by Libgcrypt and must be invoked before any other function in the
library, with the exception of the <code>GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS</code> command
(called via the <code>gcry_control</code> function). 
See <a href="Multi_002dThreading.html#Multi_002dThreading">Multi-Threading</a>.

        <p>Furthermore, this function returns the version number of the library. 
It can also verify that the version number is higher than a certain
required version number <var>req_version</var>, if this value is not a null
pointer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Libgcrypt uses a concept known as secure memory, which is a region of
memory set aside for storing sensitive data.  Because such memory is a
scarce resource, it needs to be setup in advanced to a fixed size. 
Further, most operating systems have special requirements on how that
secure memory can be used.  For example, it might be required to install
an application as &ldquo;setuid(root)&rdquo; to allow allocating such memory. 
Libgcrypt requires a sequence of initialization steps to make sure that
this works correctly.  The following examples show the necessary steps.

   <p>If you don't have a need for secure memory, for example if your
application does not use secret keys or other confidential data or it
runs in a controlled environment where key material floating around in
memory is not a problem, you should initialize Libgcrypt this way:

<pre class="example">       /* Version check should be the very first call because it
          makes sure that important subsystems are intialized. */
       if (!gcry_check_version (GCRYPT_VERSION))
         {
           fputs ("libgcrypt version mismatch\n", stderr);
           exit (2);
         }
     
       /* Disable secure memory.  */
       gcry_control (GCRYCTL_DISABLE_SECMEM, 0);
     
       /* ... If required, other initialization goes here.  */
     
       /* Tell Libgcrypt that initialization has completed. */
       gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INITIALIZATION_FINISHED, 0);
</pre>
   <p>If you have to protect your keys or other information in memory against
being swapped out to disk and to enable an automatic overwrite of used
and freed memory, you need to initialize Libgcrypt this way:

<pre class="example">       /* Version check should be the very first call because it
          makes sure that important subsystems are initialized. */
       if (!gcry_check_version (GCRYPT_VERSION))
         {
           fputs ("libgcrypt version mismatch\n", stderr);
           exit (2);
         }
     
     <a name="sample_002duse_002dsuspend_002dsecmem"></a>/* We don't want to see any warnings, e.g. because we have not yet
          parsed program options which might be used to suppress such
          warnings. */
       gcry_control (GCRYCTL_SUSPEND_SECMEM_WARN);
     
       /* ... If required, other initialization goes here.  Note that the
          process might still be running with increased privileges and that
          the secure memory has not been initialized.  */
     
       /* Allocate a pool of 16k secure memory.  This make the secure memory
          available and also drops privileges where needed.  */
       gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INIT_SECMEM, 16384, 0);
     
     <a name="sample_002duse_002dresume_002dsecmem"></a>/* It is now okay to let Libgcrypt complain when there was/is
          a problem with the secure memory. */
       gcry_control (GCRYCTL_RESUME_SECMEM_WARN);
     
       /* ... If required, other initialization goes here.  */
     
       /* Tell Libgcrypt that initialization has completed. */
       gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INITIALIZATION_FINISHED, 0);
</pre>
   <p>It is important that these initialization steps are not done by a
library but by the actual application.  A library using Libgcrypt might
want to check for finished initialization using:

<pre class="example">       if (!gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INITIALIZATION_FINISHED_P))
         {
           fputs ("libgcrypt has not been initialized\n", stderr);
           abort ();
         }
</pre>
   <p>Instead of terminating the process, the library may instead print a
warning and try to initialize Libgcrypt itself.  See also the section on
multi-threading below for more pitfalls.
